## Known Issues:
- Non-mod components are not listed in curseforge zip manifests. I may combat this by using Prism Launcher or Modrinth .mrpacks instead. For now, resource packs must be manually installed, unless I include them in this repo...
- Modrinth mods cannot be sent to a curseforge zip without it appending the jarfile. This means they must be manually downloaded as well. Only affects Nvidium, which isn't required if you use any iris shaders.
